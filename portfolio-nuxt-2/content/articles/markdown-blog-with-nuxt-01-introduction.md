Hey, all! Today, we'll be adding a blog feature to our website.

Our site is powered by [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), a framework for building [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) apps. 

Nuxt has a powerful **static site generator**, and is able to build all of our unique pages and links into a static site.

Using this, we can deploy to static hosting services, such as GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, and Netlify. 

## Blogs

What exactly do we need to build?

A blog consists of three key components:

- List view (the selection of posts)
- Detail view (a dedicated page for each post)
- The blog's content

So, let's jump in!
